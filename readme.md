iVampire Modification for Teeworlds
=========
*iVampire* is a modifcation of the well-known Teeworlds-modification *Instagib*. It was developed to give You the chance to control the match and your enemies! Get enormous power through blasting your enemies and take them the chance to get any kill by healing up your teammates!

Gameplay
---------
* Use the laser to smash your enemies (like in instagib).
* Spawn with 1 health and feel your strength, when you steal enemies health points through killing them!
* Heal your teammates in fantastic matches, to prevent that your enemies can gain any kills!
* Reach up to 6 health points (by default) and feel like being immortal!

Features
---------
### iVampire specific features
* Laser deals two damage
* Lifesteal: Kill an enemy to gain 1 health
* Damagestars indicate remaining health
* Healing System for enhanced teamplay: Hit teammates to transfer one health point
(Only when you have more than 1 health point, you cant suicide this way)

### General features
* (Laser) Instagib and Grenade Instagib
* Laser Jumps: The laser will explode upon hitting a near wall, dealing no damage but pushing you away
* Spawn Protection: You can not be killed right after spawning, to prevent spawn camping.
* Killing Sprees: The armor bar indicates your subsequent kills. You have to kill every 15 s, or your spree runs out. Every 5 kills your spree level increases, and a colored broadcast message with your name appears (cool!).
